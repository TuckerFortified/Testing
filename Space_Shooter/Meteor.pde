//Establish vectors

//Inside setup:

  //Set a random direction for the meteor to move in

//Inside the display function:

  //Update the position of the vector

  //Draw the meteor at the position of the vector

  //Update the collision values of the meteor

  //If the collision is overlapping with the player collision, then draw a death screen, and then set the gamestart to false

  //If the meteor is off of the screen, reset the position and randomize the direction
